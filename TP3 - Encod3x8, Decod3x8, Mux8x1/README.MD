For this project I had to design and simulate three different circuits: an encod3x8, a mux8x1, and a decod3x8.

The encod3x8 circuit takes three inputs and generates an output based on the input combination. The output is a binary code that corresponds to the input number. In this project, I had to design the circuit using logic gates and implement it using the MaxPlusII simulator.

The mux8x1 circuit, also known as a multiplexer, is a combinational logic circuit that selects one of eight input lines and outputs it on a single output line based on the control inputs. For this project, I designed a mux8x1 circuit using logic gates and implemented it using the MaxPlusII simulator.

Lastly, the decod3x8 circuit takes a 3-bit input and generates 8 outputs based on the input combination. The output of this circuit is an 8-bit binary code, where only one bit is high based on the input combination. I designed the circuit using logic gates and implemented it using the MaxPlusII simulator.

Overall, this project allowed me to practice designing combinational logic circuits using logic gates and implementing them using a simulation software.
