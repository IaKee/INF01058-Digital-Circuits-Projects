# 4-bit synchronous counter with input loading

This is a 4-bit synchronous counter circuit that can load values based on the input vector IN when requested by FUNC3. The counter stops counting and maintains its current value when FUNC0 is activated.

## Components

The following components are used in this circuit:

- D flip-flops: Four D flip-flops are used to store the current value of the counter. These flip-flops are connected in a cascade configuration to form a 4-bit register.
- AND gates: Two AND gates are used to generate the load signal for the flip-flops. One AND gate is used to generate the load signal for the least significant bit (LSB) of the counter, while the other is used for the three most significant bits (MSBs).
- OR gates: Two OR gates are used to generate the clock signal for the flip-flops. One OR gate is used to generate the clock signal for the LSB flip-flop, while the other is used for the MSB flip-flops.
- Counter control logic: This circuit includes a control logic block that generates the load and clock signals for the flip-flops based on the input signals FUNC0, FUNC3, and IN.

## Functionality

The counter starts counting when FUNC0 is activated, and the count value increments on every clock cycle. When FUNC3 is activated, the input vector IN is loaded into the counter, and the counter starts counting from the loaded value. The load signal is generated by the AND gates, which are activated by FUNC3 and the carry output of the LSB flip-flop. The clock signal is generated by the OR gates, which are activated by FUNC0 and the carry output of the previous flip-flop.

This circuit is useful in applications where it is necessary to load a specific value into a counter, and then count from that value. It can also be used in applications where the count value needs to be maintained and not reset after reaching its maximum value.
