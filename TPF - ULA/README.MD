# 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ULA)

The 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ULA) is a project for the final assignment, which includes the implementation of an 8-function arithmetic logic unit. The ULA can perform different arithmetic and logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, NEG, ADD, SUB, and SHL. The selection of operations is based on the 3-bit input received by the function selector C.

This ULA is designed to operate on 4-bit binary numbers, with each bit representing either 0 or 1. The ULA is a combinational logic circuit, meaning that it performs the desired operations in a single clock cycle. This ULA is intended to be used in digital circuits and computer systems where arithmetic and logical operations are required.

The AND and OR operations are used to perform logical conjunction and disjunction of the input bits, respectively. The NOT operation is used to invert the input bit, while the NEG operation is used to perform two's complement on the input bit. The ADD operation is used to perform binary addition, and the SUB operation is used to perform binary subtraction. The SHL operation is used to shift the input bits to the left by one position.

The ULA is implemented using basic digital logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR gates, and a multiplexer for selecting the desired operation based on the input selector. The ULA can be designed and simulated using hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL.

Overall, the 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit is a fundamental component of digital circuits and computer systems, providing the necessary arithmetic and logical operations for processing binary numbers.
