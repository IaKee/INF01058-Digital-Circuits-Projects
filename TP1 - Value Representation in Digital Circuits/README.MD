# First assignment of the INF01058 - Digital Circuits

We were tasked with representing a hexadecimal value based on my student ID in various forms, including binary and decimal integers, truth table, BLIF, term_0 or term_1 (min term or max term), Veitch diagram, waveform, and bipartite graph.

To accomplish this, I used the MaxPlusII simulator from Altera. This project allowed me to practice the skills necessary for representing digital circuits in different ways, as well as the ability to use a digital simulator to test my designs.

Overall, this project was an excellent introduction to the course, and it helped me gain a deeper understanding of digital circuits' fundamentals.
